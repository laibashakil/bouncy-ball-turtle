# Bouncy Ball

This is a simple Python program that simulates a bouncing ball using the Turtle module. The ball falls under the influence of gravity, bouncing when it reaches the bottom of the screen.

## Instructions

1.  Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
3.  Run the `bouncy_ball.py` file using a Python interpreter.

## Usage

Upon running the script, a window titled "Bouncy Ball" will appear with a green background. You will see a black ball initially positioned at the top of the window. The ball will fall under the influence of gravity and bounce when it hits the bottom of the window.

## Features

-   Simple and intuitive bouncing ball animation.
-   Gravity simulation for realistic movement.
-   Automatic termination of the program when the window is closed.

## Requirements

-   Python 3.x
-   Turtle module (included in Python standard library)
