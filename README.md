# Bouncy Ball
A simple Python program that simulates a bouncing ball using the Turtle library.

# Description
This program creates a bouncing ball animation using the Turtle library in Python. The ball starts at a fixed position on the screen and bounces up and down with a simulated gravity effect. The animation is simple and interactive, making it a fun way to learn the basics of Python programming.

# Installation
To use this program, you will need to have Python and the Turtle library installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you have Python installed, you can install the Turtle library by running the following command in your terminal:

`pip install turtle`

# Usage
To use the program, simply run the bouncy_ball.py file in your Python environment. The animation will start automatically, and you can watch the ball bounce up and down. You can also modify the code to adjust the speed and behavior of the ball.
